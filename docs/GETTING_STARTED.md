# Getting Started

## Linux
- Clone the repository.
- Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs).
- Open the project folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

At this point, there are two options to open a new tunnel.

### Method 1: Run & Debug
- Install the [CodeLLDB](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb) VS Code extension.
- In VS Code, press F5 to run & debug Burrow.\
This flow does not work yet (panics).

### Method 2: Cargo
- In VS Code, press Ctrl+\` to open the terminal.
- Type `cargo run`. 
- Burrow should open a new tunnel (`Ok("tun0")`), then exit.
